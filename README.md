# TFM-CrowdLearning

Àlex Padrós Zamora

In this Master Thesis we study some classical approaches for crowd annotation models such as the pooled multinomial model or the Dawid-Skene models. In particular, our problem is a probabilistic graphical model. We propose an algorithm that aims to solve the problem of label-switching for generic inference platforms such as STAN. We also study its performance by means of the Kullback-Leibler divergence.
